                <p> <b> Special rules for partnerships.</b> Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United
                    States
                    are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners’ share of
                    effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9
                    has not
                    been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a
                    foreign
                    person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a
                    partner in a
                    partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership
                    to
                    establish your
                    U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.
                    <br>
                    In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of
                    establishing
                    its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership

                    individual may use
                    the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most
                    tax
                    treaties contain a provision known as a “saving clause." Exceptions specified in the saving clause
                    may permit
                    an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise

                <ol>
                    <li>The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption

                        a nonresident alien.</li>

                    <b>Examp/e. </b> Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for

                    will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5

                    years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984)
                    allows the
                    provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident
                    alien of the
                    United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first

                    <b>How to get a TIN.</b> If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN,
                    get Form
                    SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at
                    www.SSA.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS
                    Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for
                    Employer
                    Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS
                    website at
                    www.irs.govj'Businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a
                    Business. Go to
                    www.irs.govi'Forms to view, download, or print Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4. Or, you can go to
                    www.irs.govi'OrderForms to place an order and have Form W-7 and/or SS-4 mailed to you within 10
                    business days.

                <p>
                    If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied For”
                    in the
                    space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend
                    payments,
                    and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60
                    days to get
                    a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The
                    60-day rule
                    does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such
                    payments
                    until you provide your TIN to the requester.
                    <br>
                    <b>Note:</b> Entering "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend

                <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, SSN, or other
                    identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief
                    may use
                    your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.</p>
                <ul>
                    To reduce your risk:
                    <li>Protect your SSN,</li>
                    <li>Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and</li>
                    <li>Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. </b> <br>
                    Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails
                    and
                    websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established
                    legitimate
                    enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used
                    for identity
                    theft.

                <p>Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons
                    (including
                    federal agencies) who are required to file information returns with the IRS to report interest,
                    dividends, or
                    certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of
                    secured
                    property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The
                    person
                    collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS,
                    reporting the
                    above information.
                    <br> Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and
                    criminal
                    litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions
                    for use in
